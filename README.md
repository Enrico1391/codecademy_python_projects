# codecademy-python-projects
A collection of my first Python projects done on Codecademy and VSCode.

# Introduction
Welcome to my codecademy-python-projects repository! This collection contains some of my first Python projects, completed as part of my learning journey on Codecademy and in VSCode. As I delved into Python programming, I documented my progresses and shared these projects for others who are also interested in Python.

Feel free to explore the projects and use them in any way you like. If you have feedbacks, don't hesitate to reach out.

# Project List
**Project 1**: Learn Python3 / hello-world / block-letters / initials.py

# Usage
Each project can be run independently. Simply open the respective Python file in your preferred Python environment (such as VSCode or IDLE) and run it to see the project in action.
